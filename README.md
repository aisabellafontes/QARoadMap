# QARoadMap

The idea of this repo is to help fellow QAs/testers to learn and grow. 
I got the idea of gathering material from this [QA Roadmap](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kkqqHXk=/) and from another studying list [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
Feel free to add more information!

## How to use it

<summary>How to use it</summary>

I'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check progress.
**Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]**
